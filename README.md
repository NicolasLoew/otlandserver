# otlandserver
This is a project forged by the Community Otland.net sponsored by Damon.
The main goal this project will be looking to achieve is to create a FUN environment to enjoy and create something together.


Directories:
/otlandserver
 /server --> Includes the server data files which will be pulled once a week after being reviewed by Damon and other Mods.
 
IMPORTANT:
Please make sure to not destory other people's work and rather try to improve it. Also if people leave notes in map editor on e.g. signs don't remove them and respect them instead. 

About the Server:
Client:
IP:
The server is running on a small vps machine which is running idle. It has only 1GB RAM aka low specs so don't expect the server to handle lots of players.
